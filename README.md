# ProFAB: Protein Functional Annotation Benchmark

ProFAB is a benchmarking platform for GO term and EC number prediction. It provides several datasets, featurization and scaling methods, machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. 

![Figure_1_300](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37181660/190237906-2444d0b7-1658-47ae-8dcb-f67af855e366.jpg)

As seen from the figure, in ProFAB, four main modules [import_dataset](profab/import_dataset), [model_preprocess](profab/model_preprocess), 
[model_learn](profab/model_learn), [model_evaluate](profab/model_evaluate) are employed.
- ***import_dataset***: lets to construct individual datasets for each GO term and EC number.
- ***model_preprocess***: provides three submodules for data preprocessing i.e., splitting, featurization and scaling.
- ***model_learn***: consists of several machine learning algorithms for binary classification. In this module, hyperparameter optimization is automatically done to determine the best performing models.
- ***model_evaluate***: provides several evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the trained models.

ProFAB availabilty:
    Operating System: Platform independent (except Protein Feature Extraction which can be run in LINUX and MAC.)\
    Programming language: Python: >=3.7\
    Package Requirements: tqdm (4.63.0), requests 2.27.1), numpy (1.21.2), scikit-learn (1.0.1), pytorch 1.9.1

## How to use ProFAB:

<br/>ProFAB has many workloads, therefore, reading the introductions is highly recommended. Detailed explanations can be found in each module: [import_dataset](profab/import_dataset), [model_preprocess](profab/model_preprocess), [model_learn](profab/model_learn), [model_evaluate](profab/model_evaluate).

To run ProFAB on terminal, [easy_profab](easy_profab.py) can be used. Its parameters are given in Table.1:

Table.1: Parameters to run ProFAB on terminal:
    
| Parameters (type) | options | default | Definition                                      |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:---------:|:---------|
file_name (str)|-|-| File includes dataset names such as GO_0000018, GO_1905523. If *isUser* = True or *isFasta* = True, then directory to dataset folder must be defined in input file. Each must be defined in new line
score_path (str)|-|'score_path.csv'| A destination where scores are saved. It must be .csv file
model_path (str)|-|None| A destination where model parameters of given dataset are saved. 
set_type (str)| 'random'<br/>'similarity'<br/>'temporal'| 'random'| split type of data, random: random splitting, target: similarity based splitting, temporal: splitting according to annotation time. If *isUser* or *isFasta* is True, random splitting will be applied to data even though set_type is not 'random' splitting. 'similarity' and 'temporal' splitting options are valid for only ProFAB datasets.
protein_feature (str)| 'paac'<br/>'aac'<br/>'gaac'<br/>'ctriad'<br/>'ctdt'<br/>'soc_number'<br/>'kpssm' | 'paac'| numerical features of protein sequences. If *isFasta* = True, options can be found in [Table.2, Table.3 and Table.4](profab/utils/feature_extraction_module/README.md) 
ratio (float, list)| - | 0.2 | used to split data into train, test, validation sets as given values. If ratio = a (float), then test will be a% of total data size. If ratio = [a,b] where a and b are in (0,1), train, test and validation sets are formed according to them. For example, If a = 0.2 and b = 0.1, train fraction is 0.7, test fraction is 0.2 and validation fraction is 0.1 of all dataset size. If set_type = 'temporal', then ratio = None is set automatically by ProFAB.
pre_determined (bool)| - | False | if False, data is given according to ratio type, If True, already splitted data will provided
scale_type (str)| 'normalizer'<br/>'standard'<br/>'max_abs'<br/>'min_max'<br/>'robust'|'standard' |determines the method to scale the data
ml_type (str) | 'logistic_reg'<br/>'ridge_class'<br/>'KNN'<br/>'SVM'<br/>'random_forest'<br/>'MLP'<br/>'naive_bayes'<br/>decision_tree'<br/>'gradient_boosting'<br/>'xgboost'<br/>'lightgbm'<br/>'CNN'<br/>'RNN'<br/>'CNN' |'logistic_reg'| type of machine learning algorithm
isFasta (bool) | - |False| If True, a data provided by user is Fasta file else numerical data should be introduced. While *isUser* = True, this parameter cannot be True at the same time. Format of fasta files must be **.fasta** and names of files should describe label. The path described in input file must include these files: "positive_data.fasta" and "negative_data.fasta"
output_fasta (str) | - | '' | Name of folder where output will be saved
max_len (int) | - | -1 | Max sequence lenght to embed (arg for NLP methods)
place_protein_id (int)| - | 1 | It indicates the place of protein id in fasta header. e.g. fasta header: >sp|O27002|....|....|...., seperate the header wrt. '|' then >sp is in the zeroth position, protein id in the first(1) position
isUser (bool)| - | False| If True, user data path must be defined in input file. While *isFasta* = True, this parameter cannot be True at the same time. If *label* = False, names of files should describe label. As an example, The path described in input file must include these files: "positive_data.txt" and "negative_data.txt". If ***label*** = True, it doesn't matter
delimiter (str)| '\t' (tab)<br/>',' (comma)<br/>' ' (space)|'\t'| a character to separate columns in file
name (bool)| - |False| If True, then first colmun is considered as name of inputs else the first column is a feature column
label (bool)| - | False| If True, then last colmun is considered as label of inputs else the last column is a feature column 
multi_label (bool)| - | False | If True, then all terms will be classified together. (multilabel classification)

<br/>It can be run on terminal with a single line:

where *isFasta* = False and *isUser* = False, use support vector machine as training algorithms and save perfomance
of model to *my_score_path.csv*:
```{python}
python easy_profab.py --file_name sample_inputs.txt --score_path my_score_path.csv --ml_type SVM
```
where *isUser* = True, use k-nearest neighbor as training algorithm and test fraction is 0.3 and feature matrices include names of instances:
```{python}
python easy_profab.py --file_name sample_inputs_userTrue.txt --isUser True --ml_type KNN --ratio 0.3 --name True
```
where *isFasta* = True, use random forest as training algorithm , protein descriptor is CTRIAD, test fraction is 0.1 & validation fraction is 0.2:
```{python}
python easy_profab.py --file_name sample_inputs_fastaTrue.txt --isFasta True --ml_type random_forest --protein_feature CTriad --ratio 0.1,0.2
```

<br/>ProFAB can be run in pythonic way. How to apply its functions are shown in two different use cases. [use_case_1](use_case/use_case_1.ipynb) is based on utilizing ProFAB datasets whereas [use_case_2](use_case/use_case_2.ipynb) is based on integrating user itself datasets. Detailed explanations can be found in links.
