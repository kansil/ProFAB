    Description:
        ECNO is a function to import enzyme commssion number data. It gives X data 
        and y data separately 
    Parameters:
        ratio: {None, float, list}, (default = 0.2): used to split data 
                into train, test, validation sets as given values. If left None, 
                only X and y data can be obtained while float value gives train 
                and test set. If ratio = a (float), then test will be a% of total 
                data size. If ratio = [a,b] where a and b are in (0,1), 
                train, test and validation sets are formed according to them. For example, 
                If a = 0.2 and b = 0.1, train fraction is 0.7, test fraction is 0.2 
                and validation fraction is 0.1 of all dataset size. If set_type = 'temporal', 
                then ratio = None automatically.

                according to ratio type, If True, already splitted data will

                If 'positive', only positive set is given.
